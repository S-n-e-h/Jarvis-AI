As a content writer, I'd be happy to guide you on how to write a formal letter. Here's a step-by-step guide:

**Step 1: Heading**

* Write your name and address on the top right corner of the page.
* Make sure to include your street address, apartment or suite number, city, state, and zip code.

**Step 2: Date**

* Write the date on which you are writing the letter, below your address.
* Use the month, day, and year (e.g., January 12, 2023**).

**Step 3: Inside Address**

* Write the recipient's name and address on the left side of the page, below the date.
* Use their formal title (Mr./Ms./Mrs./Dr./Prof.) followed by their first and last name.
* Make sure to include their street address, apartment or suite number, city, state, and zip code.

**Step 4: Salutation**

* Begin your letter with a formal greeting, such as "Dear Mr./Ms./Mrs./Dr./Prof." followed by the recipient's last name.

**Step 5: Body**

* Divide your letter into paragraphs, with a space between each paragraph.
* Clearly state the purpose of your letter in the first paragraph.
* Provide supporting details or explanations in subsequent paragraphs.
* Keep your tone formal and professional throughout the letter.

**Step 6: Closing**

* End your letter with a formal closing, such as "Sincerely" or "Yours faithfully".
* Leave a few lines of space below the closing for your signature.

**Step 7: Signature**

* Sign your name above your printed name.
* Make sure your signature is legible and consistent with your name.

**Step 8: Enclosures (if applicable)]**

* If you're including any attachments, such as a resume or a document, mention them below your signature.
* Use a notation such as "Enclosure: [Name of attachment]".

Here's a sample formal letter:
